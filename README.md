### Hi there 👋

I'm Sara, I'm frontend developer. I was looking for a change in my professional life and a new challenge, so I started studying front end development. I like technology, and in this case knowing how the creation processes are carried out from the beginning, from a web page to an application, servers, databases... I want to continue training in what that I have learned and acquire new knowledge!                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                         
✴️ HTML5 - CSS3 - SASS - Git - JavaScript - React - Node JS - Express JS - SQL - VS Code - Terminal - Gulp - Zeplin - Linter - Bootstrap - Slack - Agile ✴️
