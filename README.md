### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara, I'm frontend developer. I was looking for a change in my professional life and a new challenge, so I started studying front end development. I like technology, and everything you can learn, and in this case knowing how the creation processes are carried out from the beginning, from a web page to an application, servers, databases... I want to continue training in what that I have learned and acquire new knowledge!


- :mortar_board: I just finished the Adalab bootcamp
- :dizzy: so I'm in the process of looking for a job.
- :computer: Now Iâ€™m working on my portfolio! And thinking of new projects to practice :pencil:
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, Node JS, SQL... I will be happy to show what I have learned :blush:
